I want to become an astronaut. For some years, and with no apparent reason, that is the only thing I can think of when wondering about what would really make me feel accomplished.

I have developed a strong feeling that becoming an astronaut would make me happy. I want to do things that are hard, challenging, and rare. And I want to become the kind of person that could fly to space and survive. And I want to see the earth from space.

My background is not perfectly fitting for this kind of career, but, according to what I have been reading and researching, it's kind of ok. 
I am a 26-year-old male from Italy. And being from Italy is good, because Italian astronauts exist. If I were from a anywhere else, there is a good chance that things would be much harder.

I am currently pursuing a PhD in Computer Science. This is also good, as having a PhD in a scientific discipline seems to be quite a strong requirement for applicants with non-military backgrounds.

My academic backround is also quite good. Not crazy good, not prodigy-genious good, but it should do the trick. I hold a Bachelor's and a Master's in computer engineering, and I always graduated with the highest possible grade, including high school. 
If there's something I learned bby listening to astronauts explain the selection process, it does seem like they don't expect prodigy-level background in some specific thing. They are looking for skilled generalists, not for triple gold medals at math olympiads that cannot tie their shoes, so I believe that my academic background shouldn't disqualify me by default, at least.

Let's get physical now. I am ~182cm tall (if you're American, that's a bunch of feet and inches together).  This perfectly fits in the range for ESA, which should be 153cm to 190cm, or at least that's what they said on twitter. (https://twitter.com/esa/status/1093072259529539584?s=20&t=qCLHdU-PDlLI-lPDdWEmlg)
I am also fit and extremely active, which should also really help. I have played waterpolo my whole life, and after that I have tried a bit of everything. I have recently completed a half ironman triathlon (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ironman_70.3) and, since moving to Switzerland, I have picked up climbing as well. (cite pesquet).
I also intermittedly do combat sports (muai thai, jiu jitsu), but I am a real newbie there.
Again, astronauts are not supposed to be world-class athletes, but they must be fit and healthy. And for the healthy part, I surely have things to improve.

As far as medical conditions are concerned, I don't know of any genetic condition that might exclude me, although that does not mean that I don't have any. I am lucky enough that I've always been healthy, and I never incurred in any medical issues that required particular attention. Again, this could still mean that I'll be excluded from the selection for medical reasons.

The things I've been discussing all concern points that might get me excluded from the initial application.
